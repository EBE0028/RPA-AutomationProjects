Robotic process automation 

 About RPA:
 
          Robotic process automation (RPA) is the application of technology that provides organisations with a digital workforce that follows rule-based business processes and interacts with the organisations' systems in the same way that existing users currently do. Blue Prism has been credited for coining the term "Robotic Process Automation."

          RPA is a growing industry and is expected to reach $3.11 billion by 2025. It has been used to handle the requests generated by the General Data Protection Regulation; by Tokio Marine Kiln for back-office transaction framework; by the nutrition company, Fonterra, to fix quantity mismatches in planning software SAP; and by Milaha for the entry, processing and transfer of data. The independent market research company Forrester Research identified Blue Prism as one of three companies that is considered a leader in the robotic process automation field both in terms of their market presence as well as the quality of their offering in a 2017 study.

          An October 2018 study by Grand View Research, Inc. stated that the key companies in the RPA market included: Automation Anywhere, Inc.; Blue Prism Group PLC; UIPath; Be Informed B.V.; OpenSpan; and Jacada, Inc. In 2019, Gartner released its 'Magic Quadrant' for RPA, and Blue Prism was one of the leaders in the market.
